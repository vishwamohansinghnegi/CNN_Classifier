## Overview

This project utilizes the pre-trained **VGG16** model, fine-tuned for binary image classification to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It includes multiple stages for data ingestion, model preparation, training, evaluation, and testing. Additionally, there are research notebooks that help explore various aspects of the model and data pipeline.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Conda (for environment management)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishwamohansinghnegi/CNN_Classifier.git
   cd CNN_Classifier
   ```

2. **Create and activate the virtual environment**:

   Run the `init_setup.sh` script to create a Conda environment and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   bash init_setup.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Create a Conda environment with Python 3.8.
   - Install the dependencies listed in `requirements_dev.txt`.

3. **Install the package**:

   If you need to install the project package, use:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

1. **Train the model**:

   You can initiate the training pipeline by running:

   ```bash
   python src/CNNClassifier/pipeline/train.py
   ```

   This will start the training process based on the configurations in the `params.yaml` file, using the **VGG16** base model to classify cat and dog images.

2. **Run single prediction using Streamlit**:

   To test a single image prediction, you can use the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will launch a web interface where you can upload an image and get a prediction (cat vs dog) from the trained model.

## Pipeline and Components

The project contains multiple stages in both the **components** and **pipeline** folders, with the following stages:

### Pipeline Stages

- **data_ingestion**: 
  - Responsible for fetching, preprocessing, and splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets (cat and dog images).
  - Located at: `src/CNNClassifier/pipeline/data_ingestion.py`
  
- **prepare_base_model**:
  - Sets up the **VGG16** architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, and fine-tunes it for the cat vs dog classification task.
  - Located at: `src/CNNClassifier/pipeline/prepare_base_model.py`

- **train**:
  - Handles the model training process, fine-tuning VGG16 for cat vs dog image classification.
  - Located at: `src/CNNClassifier/pipeline/train.py`

- **evaluate**:
  - Manages the model evaluation, generating accuracy, loss, and other metrics on the validation/test datasets.
  - Located at: `src/CNNClassifier/pipeline/evaluate.py`

### Components Stages

These stages mirror the pipeline but focus on the implementation details:
- **data_ingestion**: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
- **prepare_base_model**: Defines the **VGG16** CNN architecture.
- **train**: Contains logic for training the model.
- **evaluate**: Computes performance metrics on test data.

## Artifacts

The `artifacts/` directory contains the outputs and models generated during different stages of the pipeline:
- **data_ingestion**: Contains the image data for cats and dogs.
  - E.g., `artifacts/data_ingestion/PetImages/Cat/0.jpg`, `artifacts/data_ingestion/PetImages/Dog/1.jpg`
  
- **prepare_base_model**: Contains the VGG16 model files.
  - `artifacts/prepare_base_model/base_model.h5`: The pre-trained VGG16 model.
  - `artifacts/prepare_base_model/base_model_updated.h5`: The fine-tuned VGG16 model.

- **training**: Contains the final trained model.
  - `artifacts/training/model.h5`: The trained CNN model.

## Configuration

The project uses the `params.yaml` file to store configurable parameters like:
- Model hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, batch size)
- Data paths for training, validation, and testing (cat and dog images)
- Other project-specific parameters

You can update this file to adjust your training and testing settings.
